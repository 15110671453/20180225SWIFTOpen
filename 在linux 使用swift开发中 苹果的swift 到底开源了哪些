The Swift Core Libraries project provides higher-level functionality than the Swift standard library. These libraries provide powerful tools that developers can depend upon across all the platforms that Swift supports. The Core Libraries have a goal of providing stable and useful features in the following key areas:

1、Commonly needed types, including data, URLs, character sets, and specialized collections

2、Unit testing

3、Networking primitives

4、Scheduling and execution of work, including threads, queues, and notifications

5、Persistence, including property lists, archives, JSON parsing, and XML parsing

6、Support for dates, times, and calendrical calculations

7、Abstraction of OS-specific behavior

8、Interaction with the file system 

9、Internationalization, including date and number formatting and language-specific resources

10、User preferences
